### 6PCT_RULE
**Why is profit-sharing capped at 6 % in a combo plan?**  
When a defined-benefit (cash balance) and a defined-contribution plan coexist, IRC §404(a)(7) limits the deductible employer contribution to the DC plan if the DB contribution for the year exceeds 25 % of covered payroll. For owner-only, PBGC-exempt cash-balance plans that are maximally funded, the safe-harbor solution is to hold the 401(k) profit-sharing piece to **6 % of W-2 or net SE income**. That keeps *all* contributions fully deductible and avoids the excise tax on excess deductions. (Catch-up deferrals are never counted toward the 6 % cap.)

### QBI_IMPACT
**Qualified Business Income (QBI) interaction**  
Retirement plan contributions are deductible business expenses, which means they *reduce* QBI for §199A purposes. A lower QBI can shrink the 20 % passthrough deduction—but for many high-income owners already above the SSTB phase-out, a large cash-balance contribution actually *rescues* the QBI deduction by bringing taxable income back under the threshold. In short:  
* • Below the phase-out → contribution slightly reduces the QBI deduction.  
* • Above the phase-out → contribution may reinstate it, creating a “double win.”  
Model both scenarios before finalizing salary and contribution strategy.

### COMP_OPTIM
**Setting W-2 salary vs. K-1 profit**  
Cash-balance benefits peg to **compensation** (IRC §401(a)(17) cap = $350 k in 2025). Raising W-2 wages boosts the allowable DB and 401(k) contributions but lowers K-1/QBI. A common sweet spot is to pay wages up to the comp cap if the owner wants the *largest* deductible contribution, then push remaining income through as distributions. Always weigh the extra payroll-tax cost against the much larger income-tax deduction a higher pension contribution generates.

---

### FUNDING_RANGE
**Annual funding flexibility**  
After Year 1, each cash-balance plan receives an actuarially determined **minimum required** and **maximum deductible** contribution. Think of it as a corridor: you must at least hit the minimum to keep the plan funded, but you can go anywhere up to the max if cash flow allows. Investment gains/losses and interest-crediting rate deviations will nudge that corridor up or down over time.

---

### PLAN_COMMITMENT
**Required commitment & exit strategy**  
The IRS expects a DB plan to run at least **5–7 plan years**. Terminating early—right after scoring a huge deduction—creates audit risk. Design the benefit level so the minimum required contribution is comfortable across business cycles. If future cash flow is uncertain, elect a *lower* pay-credit or adopt a variable-interest crediting design for greater flexibility.

### EMPLOYEE_WARNING
**What if non-owner employees are hired?**  
An “owner-only” projection assumes zero non-owner employees meeting eligibility. Once staff work ≥ 1000 hrs (or ≥ 500 hrs three consecutive years under SECURE 2.0) the plan must cover them and satisfy nondiscrimination tests. That will dramatically change required employer contributions. Re-run illustrations immediately if staffing plans change.

---

### DISCOUNT_RATE_MORTALITY
**Actuarial assumptions behind these numbers**  
Illustrations use a conservative **4 % funding interest rate** and the IRS **Applicable Mortality Table** for 2024 (RP-2014 adj.) as permitted under Regs. §1.415(b)-1(c). This keeps the lump-sum equivalent (and thus the annual contribution) on the high side, ensuring you remain within the statutory maximum while funding rapidly.

### AGGR_DISCUSSION
**Aggressive tier = Level + Past-Service.**  
Pros: • Biggest Yr-1 deduction • Can restore QBI benefit for very high earners.  
Cons: • Higher minimum required in Years 2-7 • Harder to dial back if cash flow dips • Greater scrutiny if plan terminates early.

### ENTITY_S_CORP
**S-Corp Compensation 101** — Only W-2 wages are treated as “plan compensation.” K-1 profit is invisible to the plan. Raising W-2 boosts CB and 401(k) limits but increases payroll tax (7.65 % employer + 7.65 % employee up to the Social-Security wage base). Many owners pay W-2 up to the §401(a)(17) cap when large pension deductions are the goal, then take remaining profit as distributions.

---

### ENTITY_SOLE_PROP
**Sole-Proprietor / Single-Member LLC** — “Compensation” is net self-employment income *after* the ½ SE-tax deduction. Plan contributions themselves reduce SE-tax in the following year, so allowable comp is slightly below Schedule C profit. Keep this in mind when projecting cash-flow savings.

---

### ENTITY_C_CORP
**C-Corp Owner** — Only W-2 salary counts; there is no pass-through income or §199A QBI. Pension expense is deducted on Form 1120 and does not affect shareholder salary cap calculations.

---

### ENTITY_PARTNERSHIP
**Partnership or Multi-Member LLC** — Compensation equals W-2 wages (if any) **plus** guaranteed payments shown on the partner’s K-1. Pension deductions reduce ordinary business income, thus reduce each partner’s QBI share under §199A.

These numbers are estimates for discussion only. Final allowable contributions and deductions must be certified by an enrolled actuary and documented in signed plan materials. Consult your CPA and TPA before taking any tax position.
